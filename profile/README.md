# Game Overview
Blitz TCG速 is not just another card game. It provides players with full access to their decks, employs a chess-like timebank system for dynamic play, features General abilities to augment strategies, and introduces NPC elements to enrich gameplay. Striking a balance between two primary resources, Gold and XP (experience), and selecting a General that synergizes with your deck, opens up a world of strategic depth and tactical finesse.

# License
Anyone can use the resources of Blitz TCG速 in their own project or variant of the card game under a single condition:
1. If any of our character cards, e.g., Margo, are used in your game or project, the use or unlock of said character must reference a user's blockchain wallet to confirm ownership. For example, to unlock Margo in your fighting game, you should check a user's blockchain wallet (e.g., Ergo) for Margo's corresponding token ID and unlock Margo for use only if the user owns at least one of the Token IDs for Margo. We are more than happy to assist you with the necessary code to make this process successful and easy. This approach empowers us to provide assets for free, offers our users multiple use cases for their assets, and enables a collaborative approach to IP sharing that benefits everyone.
